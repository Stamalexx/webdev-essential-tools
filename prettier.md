[Installation guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eieTlMwCwWU)

Make sure that you have enabled **format on save** and you have selected prettier as your **Default Formatter**.

Prettier uses a prettierrc file store its configuration here is an example:

```json
tabWidth: 2
semi: true
```

This means that tab is 2 spaces and prettier will add missing semicolons automatically.
